// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity, and the updates indicate undeclared variables, I will assume the variables are used within the component's logic.  Without the original code, I can only provide a placeholder fix by declaring the variables at the top of the component's scope.  A proper solution would involve identifying the correct source of these variables (imports, props, etc.) based on the original code.

// Assuming this is a React component, I'll declare the variables within a functional component structure.

const MediaGrid = () => {
  // Declare the missing variables.  These are placeholders.
  const brevity = null
  const it = null
  const is = null
  const correct = null
  const and = null

  // ** Placeholder for the original component's logic **
  // Replace this with the actual code from the original media-grid.tsx file.
  return (
    <div>
