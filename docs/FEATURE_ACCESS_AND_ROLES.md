- **Free User**: Single user, no team, on the free plan.
- **Pro User**: Single user, no team, on a paid plan. Has full access to advanced features for their own account.

- **Admin**: Has full access to all features and pages, regardless of plan or team. Can manage all users and data.

---

## 3. Special Permissions and Super Admin Controls

- **Super Admin** can:
  - Assign or revoke the Admin role for any user
  - Grant or revoke specific admin-level permissions (e.g., user deletion, billing, team management, data export)
  - Access a dedicated "Admin Controls" panel to manage Admin permissions
  - Only Super Admins can demote other Super Admins (or this can be restricted to the account owner)

- **Admin** users:
  - Can only access admin-level features that have been enabled for them by a Super Admin
  - See only the features/pages they have been granted

- **Permissions Storage**:
  - Permissions for Admins should be stored in a dedicated table (e.g., `admin_permissions`) or as a JSONB field in `user_profiles`
  - Permissions should be enforced in both the UI and backend

---

## 4. Permission Storage and Enforcement

- **Roles and plan tiers** are stored in the `user_profiles` table:
  - `role` (enum: free, pro, team_member, team_manager, enterprise_member, enterprise_manager, admin, super_admin)
  - `plan_tier` (enum: free, pro, team, enterprise)
- **Team membership** is tracked in the `team_members` table
- **Admin permissions** (for non-super-admin Admins) are stored in `admin_permissions` or as a JSONB field in `user_profiles`
- **Feature access logic** is enforced in:
  - React context/hook (frontend)
  - API middleware/guards (backend)
- **Upgrade modal**: If a user clicks a locked feature, show a floating modal prompting upgrade or permission request

---

## 5. Edge Cases and Notes

- Any user can see all menu items, but locked features will show an upgrade modal or permission error if not eligible
- Pro users have all advanced features, but only for their own account/data
- Team/Enterprise Managers have access for their whole team/enterprise
- Team/Enterprise Members have advanced features only for their own data
- Admins always have full access unless restricted by a Super Admin
- Super Admins are the only role that can manage Admin permissions
- Enterprise plans are "Team plans on steroids"â€”all Team features, but higher limits and more advanced controls

---

## 6. Extending or Updating This Matrix

- When adding a new feature or page:
  - Update this document with access rules for each role/plan
  - Update the feature access logic in both frontend and backend code
- When changing roles or permissions:
  - Update the `role` enum and/or permission storage schema as needed
  - Communicate changes to all developers and support/admin staff
