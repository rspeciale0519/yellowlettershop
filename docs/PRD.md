- Real estate agents
- Direct mail agencies

Teams need a way to collaboratively manage these processes, track engagement, handle feedback, and route data intelligently without vendor lock-in.

- Store and manage payment methods per user account
- Assign and route orders to vendors manually or by fallback logic
- Track user engagement via per-recipient short links
- Generate reports and schedule recurring exports
- Capture user feedback post-order (NPS + comments)
